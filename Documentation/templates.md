# Templates

There is a template pack for Aksio projects.
Install it by simply doing the following from your terminal:

```shell
$ dotnet new -i Aksio.Templates
```

The templates are also supported through Visual Studio
by enabling [.NET CLI tooling](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-cli-templates-in-visual-studio/).
